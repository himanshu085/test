## Introduction
In [OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES) stack, the Frontend API is built on ReactJS which integrates with other APIs of the application.

## Purpose
The frontend web is a REACTJS-based application serving as the user interface of [OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES) stack.  
This application supports cross-platform and can be executed on multiple OS as long as a JavaScript runtime environment is available.  
A ReactJS-based web framework for complete webpage-based operations.  
Test case integration for application functionality verification.

## System Requirements
| System Requirement | Minimum Requirement |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| **OS**              | Ubuntu or other Linux-based OS |
| **Disk space**      | 20 GB |
| **RAM**             | 4 GB |
| **Processor**       | Dual-core recommended |
| **Instance Type**   | t2.small |

## Pre-requisites
| Dependencies | Details|
|--------------|--------|
| **REST APIs** | The frontend application has dependencies on other REST APIs of OT-Microservices like Employee, Attendance, and Salary APIs which need to be configured. |
| **Node.js**   | Provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side and building and packaging React code. |
| **NPM (Node Package Manager)** | Used to install, manage, and run dependencies (JavaScript libraries and tools) that the application depends upon. NPM helps manage these dependencies by adding them to a package.json file, which lists all the libraries our application depends on. |

## Architecture

## Installation Steps


## Conclusion
The Frontend API is a robust microservice designed to manage the user interface within the OT-Microservices architecture.  
The API is dynamic and interactive as it is based on ReactJS, a high-performance JavaScript library.
